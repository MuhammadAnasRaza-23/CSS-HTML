    <p class="history">
        The Briard is a French herding dog with origins dating back over a thousand years, originally bred to herd and
        guard livestock. Their ancestors likely descended from Roman herding dogs brought to France, evolving in the
        Île-de-France region. They became valued for their intelligence, loyalty, and agility, serving both as herders
        and protectors. In the 19th century, the breed was standardized and recognized by kennel clubs. Today, Briards
        are prized as both working dogs and companions, maintaining their herding instincts and protective nature.
